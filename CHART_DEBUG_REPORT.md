# API Usage Over Time Chart - Debug Report

## Issue Summary
The "API usage over time" chart on the premium dashboard was not showing up.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Chart Categories Mismatch** (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: The chart was using `serviceTotals.map(s => s.name)` for categories, but this didn't match the actual keys in `chartData`
- **Impact**: The chart couldn't render because the categories didn't align with the data structure
- **Fix**: Changed to use `getServices().map(s => getServiceDisplayName(s))` to ensure categories match the data keys

### 2. **Missing Services Handling**
- **Problem**: If no services were found in the API data, the chart would have empty categories
- **Impact**: Chart would fail to render with no error message
- **Fix**: Added fallback to show just "Total" when no services are found

### 3. **Too Much Data**
- **Problem**: If the API returns thousands of data points, the chart could be overwhelmed
- **Impact**: Browser performance issues, potential timeout
- **Fix**: Limited chart data to last 90 points maximum

### 4. **Potential Timeout Issues**
- **Problem**: Large API responses could timeout
- **Impact**: No data would be loaded
- **Fixes**:
  - Added 30-second timeout with AbortController
  - Set `maxDuration = 30` in Next.js route config
  - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent caching issues

### 5. **Insufficient Debugging**
- **Problem**: No console logs to diagnose issues
- **Impact**: Hard to identify where the problem was occurring
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout the data flow

## Changes Made

### File: `PremiumAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
1. Added console logs to track:
   - Raw API response
   - Data array lengths
   - Filtered data counts
   - Services found
   - Chart data formatting
   - Final render state

2. Fixed chart categories to use actual services from data

3. Added data limiting (90 points max) to prevent overwhelming the chart

4. Added error handling for date parsing

5. Added fallback for when no services are found

### File: `route.ts` (API Proxy)
1. Added 30-second timeout with AbortController
2. Added `maxDuration = 30` export
3. Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` export
4. Improved error handling for timeout scenarios

## How to Debug Further

1. **Open Browser Console** and look for these logs:
   - "Raw API response:" - Shows what data is coming from the API
   - "API usage array length:" - Shows how many data points exist
   - "Filtered data: X items out of Y for Zdays" - Shows filtering results
   - "Services found:" - Shows which services are in the data
   - "Chart render state:" - Shows final state before rendering

2. **Check for these specific issues**:
   - If `apiUsageLength` is 0, the API isn't returning data
   - If `filteredData` is 0 but `apiUsageLength` > 0, date filtering is too restrictive
   - If `services` array is empty, the API data doesn't have `by_service` breakdown
   - If `chartDataLength` is 0, the formatting is failing

3. **Common Scenarios**:
   - **"No data available for the selected period"**: Try changing date range (7/30/90 days)
   - **Chart shows but is empty**: Check if services array is populated
   - **Timeout error**: API is taking too long, may need to optimize backend

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open the premium dashboard
- [ ] Check browser console for logs
- [ ] Verify chart appears with data
- [ ] Try switching between 7/30/90 day views
- [ ] Try switching between area/line/bar chart types
- [ ] Check that service breakdown is visible
- [ ] Verify no timeout errors occur

## Next Steps if Issue Persists

1. Check the actual API response format from `/admin/api-usage`
2. Verify the date format matches ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Confirm `by_service` object exists in the API response
4. Check if there's too much data (>1000 points) that needs backend pagination
5. Consider adding date range parameters to the API call to reduce data volume
